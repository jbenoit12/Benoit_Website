My primary background is in physical oceanography, computational modeling, and remote sensing. Recently, I have found a passion for field work, glaciology, scientific communication, and visualizing scientific data during my time on the Juneau Icefield.",

        "description":"Using an application of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to Narragasett Bay, I simulated the effects of present and projected climatic warming in the region. Results indicate that local impact are distinct from regional impacts and that climate change is making Narragansett Bay more density stratified, which increases the estuary's suseptibility to hypoxia. This work was judged to be a Highly Commended entry to the Global Undergraduate Awards."

        "description":"Using satellite data, I conducted a post-impact analysis assessing the effect of thermal effluent (heated water) released from the Brayton Point Power Station into Narragansett Bay. I converted infrared imagery to surface temperature measurements from over 500 Landsat scenes, creating a temperature record of Narragansett Bay for the past 40 years. While the removal of the power station initially cooled the region, climatic warming over the same period has caused the entirety of Narragansett Bay to warm to the same degree as was of concern near the power station. This work culminated in a publication I lead authored in Fronteirs in Marine Science."

Reanalysis data from ERA5 was used to train and validate the model, providing insights on what large-scale meterology contributes to local waterspout favorability and exceeding past predictibility."

We conducted field work to assess glacier health, quantify the rates and causes of their melting, and explore the global implications of glaciers in recording and controlling past and modern climates. Living in such an extreme and isolated environment meant we had to learn ski mountaineering, how to live in an isolated community, and how best to work with our environments."
